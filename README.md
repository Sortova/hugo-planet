# hugo-planet: an RSS "planet" feed aggregator

## Introduction

hugo-planet is a "[planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software))" RSS feed aggregator that will create a table of links based on recent RSS feeds. The program will iterate over a list of feed URLs and retrieve the latest posts. It will then aggregate those links and generate a table of the latest ones (by default 20) into a markdown file that can be used by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate a webpage.

An example can be found at [https://tarus.io/page/planet/](https://tarus.io/page/planet/)

## Configuration

In your Hugo directory, add a page directory under `/content/page` for your planet. Copy `config.yaml` and `hugo-planet.py` into that directory.

Edit `config.yaml` to point to your feeds. Here is an example:

```
# List the RSS feeds to fetch
feed_urls:
  - https://tarus.io/index.xml
  - https://bananasl.com/index.xml
  - https://forgottencocktails.com/index.xml
  - https://adventuresinoss.com/index.xml

# Max number of items to display
num_items: 20
# Name of the output file
output_file: index.md
# Title of the index.md page to be created
yaml_title: Planet
# Author of the page
yaml_author: Tarus
# Menu Item Name
yaml_menu: Planet
# Menu Item Weight
yaml_weight: -70
# Menu Item Icon
yaml_icon: planet
```
The only non-obvious part is that for the menu icon (`yaml_icon`) you need to put an SVG file in your theme's `assets/icons` directory, in this case one named `planet.svg`.

## Usage

To generate your planet, run

```
python hugo-planet.py
```
which should generate a file called `index.md` along with the necessary front matter to allow Hugo to create the web page. Then generate your site as normal.

Note that you will need two additional Python packages: feedparser and pyyaml. 

## Caveats

This was only tested against RSS feed URLs also generated by Hugo. The script has not been tested against other sources.
